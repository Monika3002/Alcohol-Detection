##Alcohol Detection Arduino Project

This project is an alcohol detection system that utilizes an Arduino microcontroller and a MQ-3 alcohol sensor to detect the presence of alcohol in the air. The sensor is capable of detecting alcohol concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 10mg/L.

#Hardware Requirements

The following hardware components are required for this project:

Arduino UNO R3
MQ-3 Alcohol Sensor
Breadboard
Jumper Wires
LED
Resistor (220 Ohm)
Software Requirements
Arduino IDE

#Installation
Clone or download this repository.
Open the AlcoholDetection.ino file in the Arduino IDE.
Connect the Arduino board to your computer using a USB cable.
Select the correct board and port in the Arduino IDE.
Upload the sketch to the Arduino board.
Open the Serial Monitor to view the alcohol concentration readings.
#Usage
After the sketch has been uploaded to the Arduino board, the alcohol sensor will begin detecting the presence of alcohol in the air. The LED will turn on and off depending on the alcohol concentration. If the concentration is below a certain threshold, the LED will remain off. If the concentration exceeds the threshold, the LED will turn on.
